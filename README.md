# skript-economy
Link a skript variable with vault to register as an economy provider.![img.png](img.png) in this image I have player -> player's uuid enabled in skript config ![img_1.png](img_1.png) auction house plugin working with it


# compatibility
So far I've tested 1.16.5 + Skript 2.5, and 1.18 + Skript 2.6\
This also will override Essentials' Economy since the priority is set higher.![img_2.png](img_2.png)

# configuration
There's several configuration options in config.yml, such as using uuids over player names, and editing the name of the variable to use.\
There's more configuration options, just check the config.yml. Reload config with /skripteconomy.
